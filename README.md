[Project Page](https://jamesakl.com/cad-microguard) | [Renders](https://jamesakl.com/cad-microguard-renders.pdf) | [Drawings](https://jamesakl.com/cad-microguard-drawings.pdf) | [Materials](https://jamesakl.com/cad-microguard-materials.pdf)

This project examines *Security via Intimidation* with the design of a CAD model featuring a robotic defense turret. It's purely an artistic rendition without any consideration for a working system.

The file `Main.SLDASM` is the main assembly file that imports the parts and displays the fully-assembled system. Upon opening, there may be a need to re-point it to the `/parts` folder, which contains all the individuals parts.

The `/renders` folder contains various renders of the assemble and parts. The `docs` folder contains PDF documents containing renders, drawings, and a bill of materials.
