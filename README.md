This project examines *Security via Intimidation* with the design of a CAD model featuring a robotic defense turret. It's purely an artistic rendition without any consideration for a working system.

> **DISCLAIMER:** This project is only a 3D visual <u>concept model</u>, not a fully-engineered system. It's "just like in the movies", only artful visuals and not working systems. The aim is artistic and artisanal, not functional. It is "just for fun" and is <b>NOT</b> an attempt to encourage the sharing of defense system design. <b>It's just a toy</b>. The main idea was <i>security by intimidation</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, to de-escalate threats with fearful appearance without the ability to actually shoot.
